# Fixture Assembly

## Overview

This repository showcases a fixture assembly designed in **SolidWorks** to demonstrate my expertise in CAD modeling, fixture design for manufacturing, and technical documentation. The project includes a complete fixture assembly, individual part models, technical drawings, and STEP files for interoperability. The fixture is designed to securely hold and position workpieces during manufacturing processes (e.g., machining, welding, or assembly). The design is optimized for manufacturing (e.g., machining, assembly) and rapid prototyping, highlighting skills in precision engineering and process optimization.

## Project Details

The fixture assembly is a specialized tool designed to stabilize and align workpieces during manufacturing tasks, ensuring accuracy and repeatability. The project emphasizes proficiency in:

- SolidWorks modeling of functional fixture components for manufacturing support.
- Technical drawing creation for clear fabrication and assembly instructions.
- Exporting interoperable STEP files for prototyping or collaboration.
- Consideration of manufacturing processes (e.g., machining, 3D printing) and rapid prototyping workflows.

### Components

Some of the components are:

1. **Base**:
   - The primary structural component, providing a stable foundation for the fixture.
   - Designed for mounting to a machine bed or workbench.
2. **Clamp**:
   - A component for securely holding workpieces during manufacturing.
   - Adjustable design to accommodate various workpiece sizes.
3. **Guide**:
   - A precision component for aligning workpieces accurately (e.g., for machining or welding).
   - Ensures consistent positioning for repeatable results.
4. **Fixture Assembly**:
   - The complete assembly integrating all components with mates for functional operation.
   - Features an **exploded view** in the technical drawing to illustrate assembly sequence.

### Technical Drawings

- **Individual Part Drawings**:
  - Detailed drawings.
  - Include dimensions and annotations for manufacturing, with GD&T or explicit tolerances unless specified.
- **Assembly Drawing**:
  - Comprehensive drawing for `FIXTURE ASSYEMBLY` with an exploded view.
  - Includes a **Bill of Materials (BOM)** listing all components, including standard fasteners.
- **PDF Exports**:
  - All drawings are exported as PDFs for easy sharing and review (located in the `PDF/` folder).

### STEP Files

- STEP files (`.stp`) are provided for all parts and the assembly to enable:
  - Interoperability with other CAD software (e.g., Fusion 360, ETC.).
  - Rapid prototyping.
  - Compatibility with CNC machining or fabrication processes.
